## Introduction

Movie genre classification is a common task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). This project uses machine learning models to classify movies into their respective genres based on textual descriptions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of movie title, descriptions and their corresponding genres. while the test data consist of the title and the description of the movie
